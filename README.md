# Galena
Welcome to galena! An attempt to make a GBA game.

## Getting started

This project relies on butano! We've implemented submodules to cover gathering that dependency.

- Clone or pull the code down
- `git clone https://github.com/Caaz/galena.git`
- Gather the submodule dependencies
- `git submodules init`

## Building

`make` should get the job done. perhaps add the `-j#` flag, with `#` being the number of cores you've got to compile with.

## Todo

- [ ] Actually have a plan for the game. A game plan if you will.
- [ ] Add proper testing
  - Might be impossible? Or at least problematic, due the the environment?
- [ ] Figure out a linter to ensure the code is proper.
- [ ] Maybe port over ichor?

# Conttributing

Want to help? This is a part of a game jam! Ask Caaz to join the team and we'll get you set up! Right now we aren't quite ready for too much open source help but after the jam we may choose to continue this project.
