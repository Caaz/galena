# Galena
Welcome to galena! An attempt to make a GBA game.

## Building

`make`

## Testing

Right now I don't have test stuff, but I added a thing that spins up retroarch with mgba. There's likely some variables I should be using if other people want to use this, but for now it works for me.

`make test`

## Todo

- [ ] Actually have a plan for the game. A game plan if you will.
- [ ] Add proper testing
- [ ] Figure out a linter to ensure my code is proper.
- [ ] Maybe port over ichor?
